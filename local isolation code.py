## Brief Description of the Local Isolation Measure
# - The Local Isolation Measure is a spatially disaggregated measure of isolation.
# - It is computed for each point of the land surface.
# - The Local Isolation Measure is based on the Least Cost Path (LCP) algorithm, it computes the LCP for each point of the land surface grid to its nearest localities (i.e. neighboring points).
#
## Algorithm steps:
# - Load data (World Land Surface Grid, 1-by-1 degree + Cost Surface)
# - For each grid point:
#	- Extract a point for which local isolation will be computed (a.k.a. a start point)
#	- Extract points to which the LCP is computed (a.k.a. end points)
# - For each start point, compute LCP to each end point in its respective set of end points
# - For each start point, compute Local Isolation Measure as the average of Least Cost Paths to all its end points
# - Record that in the df_cntry dataframe
# 	- In df_cntry, the points of land surface grid are matched with country boundaries, however, they remain disaggregated
# - Export the df_cntry dataframe
# 
## Notes for usage:
# -  The code assumes that 'grid1dg_ctrd_cntry' file is loaded into QGIS, it is later used by 'QgsProject.instance().mapLayersByName()[0]' command
# - The code uses temporary layers heavily
# - Some of the instructions are below
